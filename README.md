# Flappy-Ball-Game
Player needs to keep pressing mouse in certain pace in order to keep the flappy ball alive, other wise the flappy ball will drop to the ground with gradually increasing speed. Once when the flappy hits the ground or crashes on either mountains or moving arrow blocks, the game is over and a notication interface pops up. The notification shows the current score that the player gained and gives an restart option to the player. <br />

In the game, color represents the object's attribute. If two objects in the game are having the same color, meaning that they won't crash into each other. So if the ball is having the same color as the obstacle, the ball can just get through this obstacle and won't be crashed into it. In order to change the current color, the flappy ball needs to touch the spinning rectangle. Once a spinning rectangle is touched it will just disapper and the ball will change to have related color. <br />
